#The syntax differences are subtle and seldom arise in practice: JSON allows 
#extended charactersets like UTF-32, YAML requires a space after separators like
#comma, equals, and colon while JSON does not, and some non-standard implementations
#of JSON extend the grammar to include Javascript's /* ... */ comments. 
#Handling such edge cases may require light pre-processing of the JSON before parsing as in-line YAML.
