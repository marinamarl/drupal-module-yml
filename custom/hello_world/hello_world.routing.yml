hello_world.content:
  path: '/hello'
  #the path of the module. example: DrupalVille/hello.
  defaults:
    _controller: '\Drupal\hello_world\Controller\HelloController::content'
    _title: 'Hello World'
  requirements:
    _permission: 'access content'

#Note that the space you reserve in the routing table for your module, the
#"hello_world" in hello_world.content on the first line, is not required to be
#the machine name you chose for your module. However, in order to be consistent
# across your routing and menu files, it is a best practice. The full entry name,
#hello_world.content, will be used in the next section, when adding a menu link,
#to wire that link into this routing table entry.

#If you already have your module activated you will need to clear your site's
#cache from the user interface at admin/config/development/performance or using
#drush (drush cache-rebuild or drush cr). If not, go ahead and activate it.

#Now navigate to the front page of your site, and then add /hello to your site's
#url in the address bar. You should see a page with the "Hello, World!" message on it.

#Please note that you have to put proper indentation for the module.routing.yml
#file else you might encounter issue with drupal cache clearing.
